# Chapel
[Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/) is a modern programming language that is...
- parallel: contains first-class concepts for concurrent and parallel computation
- productive: designed with programmability and performance in mind
- portable: runs on laptops, clusters, the cloud, and HPC systems
- scalable: supports locality-oriented features for distributed memory systems
- open-source: hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/chapel-lang/), permissively [licensed](https://chapel-lang.org/license.html)

As I got to know the language more, I found it much simpler and familiar language. It is very much similiar to the python/C++ programming languages and people who already learnt or in process of learning should try this language out.

## Compilaton
All programs are compiled by the following command-
chpl -o array array.chpl

### Note-
Installation of chapel and setting the path from the terminal is required for compilation of chapel programs.

## Examples
- 2Darray -
Implementation of 2D array and nested for loop is displayed in the example. Also by this example, we can understand multi-array mechanism in Chapel.
- array -
Implementation of array and simple for loop can be seen here.
- Basic maths operations -
Implementation of basic mathematical operations like sum, difference, product and division is present in this example.
- dataTypes -
Different primitive data types are implemented in this example.
- nestedIfElse -
Implementation of nested If-Else can be seen in this example.
- procedures -
Procedures/function can be seen in this example, also how a main procedure/function can also be seen in the example.
